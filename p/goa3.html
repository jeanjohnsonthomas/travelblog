                    <p>Welcome back fellow travelers</p>
                    <p>Today we are going to take a step away from my motorbike travel tales for a moment. This time it's about a trip where lots of unexpected things happened, lots of spontaneous plans occurred and so on. It's the story of how a trip reminded us about the teenage days, the college days in which everything was a celebration of fun and spontaneity, no work related activities, no family responsibilities etc.</p>One day, one of our friends from work suggested a trip itinerary, it's a trek to Dudhsagar waterfalls which is in goa. The train ticket to goa was already booked. But at the last moment we got news that the trek is not gonna happen due to heavy rainfall . Since we already booked the tickets, we decided to explore the south side of goa which is known for its serene nature's beauty and peaceful beaches. I have already been to goa twice, but this time decided to focus more on the southern part of Goa

                    <h2>DAY 1 : THE BEGINNING</h2>
                    <p>I reached Thampanoor railway station area at 9:00 am and parked my bike at Thampanoor Bus terminal pay and park. We all reached the railway station on time and our journey to goa started at 9:30 am. While the journey continued we met a traveler who was going to the Dudhsagar trek. She and her gang rebooked the trek with another agency and was hoping they would be able to go for the trek. Meeting new people who have a strong desire to travel always inspires me to know more about the world and motivates me to travel more. After a while, the rest of our friends from Ernakulam joined us. The fun persisted for a long time. we had a nice sleep in the train itself and before we know we reached Goa at 3:50 am the next day</p>

                    <h2>DAY 2: EXPLORING THE SOUTH</h2>
                    <p>The journey has been long and now it's dawn, so we decided to find a place to stay near the railway station itself. Luckily we found accommodation which was within one km from the railway station. We went there and decided to rest up to regain our energy, because there‚Äôs a lot of planning to do. We checked out in the morning, went to a nearby ‚ÄúNavatara‚Äù restaurant to have breakfast. Trying food in an unfamiliar place is always a challenge, but luck was on our side. The food was okay enough to fill both our soul and stomach. The mushroom masala dosa was tasty, if you are visiting this restaurant give it a try. After we had our breakfast, we booked two rental cars online to explore Goa.</p>

                    <p>As I said earlier our plan is to explore South Goa. So we got into our cars and started the ride towards the South. Our first destination is to visit Netravali wildlife sanctuary. The road towards this place is very peaceful, and traffic free. A short while later, a heavy downpour began, The force of monsoon began to reveal itself. On the way we stopped at a shop to buy ponchos, so that we can explore Goa without getting completely drenched in the rain. we were reaching our first destination, waiting eagerly to arrive, but soon our efforts were wasted, it was closed. One of the guards suggested that on the way back maybe you can visit a waterfall named ‚ÄúBamanbudo Falls‚Äù. With the reignited hope we continued our travel. On the way, we stopped at Netravali bubbling lake. I have heard that these lakes tend to give out bubbles when they interact with loud external noise. With a curious mind we decided to visit the lake. And we can confirm that the lake is beautiful and it gives out bubbles underwaterü´ß. The water is emerald green in color and the area is surrounded by dense forest. The lake was less crowded, creating a tranquil and peaceful atmosphere. After spending some time in this serene location we resumed our quest to find the Bamanbudo waterfalls. Half an hour flew by and we reached the check post of the water falls. This waterfall was also closed. When we enquired about it the guard said due to some recent accidents all the waterfalls in goa are banned from entering for a week.</p>

                    <p>Once all was in order, we headed out to visit Mannavanur. One of my friend would be arriving there at noon. We reached Mannavanur Lake viewpoint entrance at 1 pm, The location was very beautiful and refreshing. The Mannavanur lake was very beautiful, the surrounding greenery,escalated the beauty of the place. We decided to walk along the perimeter of the lake so that we could get away from the crowd and finally we found a peaceful area. The lake had an echoing effect, if you whistle or clap it would bounce back in reverberation. We took rest in front of the large lake with the lake shore covered in small grass bed, it was a perfect place to regain our energy, the peacefulness the place gave us was truly refreshing, The gentle rustling of the grasses due to the cold breeze, the serene beauty of the Mannavanur lake, surrounding lush greenery and distant mountains, everything left as in awe.</p>

                    <p>We exited the lake at around 2:30 pm and had lunch at the ‚Äúmess and cafe‚Äù restaurant which was near the exit gate. Our friend Govind reached Mannavanur after we had finished our lunch. With him joining us, we became a gang of four members in total. Next, we decided to visit Mannavanur sheep farm, which is famous in Poondi. After getting the tickets, we parked our bikes and started to check out the beautiful grazing field. We visited the rabbit farm before entering into the vast field. They got rabbits of different breeds and different sizes. some of them were very big, while some were just babies. </p>

                    </p>We spotted two herds of sheep. One was in an enclosed field within the sheep farm, and the other was in the forest outskirts, where tourists were not allowed to enter. We were able to get close-up encounters with the sheep. The grass fields in the grazing area were so vibrant green in color. We sat down on the field, facing the grazing field in the forest border and took some rest. At around 4:15 pm the shepherd will guide the big herd of sheep from the forest, back to their stable. So we decided to wait there at the small fence gate through which the sheep were going to enter the sheep farm. Trust me when I say this, It was an experience watching the sheep obediently following the shepherd and the surrounding views were spectacular which added extra beauty to the scene. I could watch that scene over and over again. The experience was exponentially rewarding.</p>

                    <p>After having a great time in Mannavanur we headed back to our tent stay and reached the there at around 5:30 pm. Four of us are going to spend the night in that single tent. It was on a hill top and we need to face the cold freezing night. We found ourselves quite unprepared for this adventure. But somehow we managed to get some sleep and it was indeed a memory to remember for a long time.</p>

                    <p>After waking up from the tent, we were greeted by amazing views, the hills that bathed in the soft morning sunlight, cascading waterfalls, the green fields everything was full of life. It was a visual symphony. but it was coming to an end , its time for us to start our return journey. We departed our stay around 9:30 am. Later,we stopped at Kodaikanal observatory and had our breakfast from a small street shop, and also purchase some fresh carrots. The area was getting crowded, so after having the bread and omelet we continued our journey. We had a plan to eat authentic dindigul thalapakaty biryani, for that we took a short deviation and reach Dindigul just to eat the biriyani and drink masala cola. Both of them were delicious, the biriyani taste was new to me, I really liked it and I would definetly recommend it to you.</p>

                    <p> After fulfilling our cravings, we continued our journey to Cumbum. The reason why we stopped here was to visit the vineyard. Cumbum is famous for the grapes it produces. It was my first time visiting a vineyard and I was not sure what to expect. We were allowed to walk inside it, at the end of the field there was a shop which was selling freshly made grape juice. Because of the good taste we all drank an extra cup of grape juice. After capturing some photos we continued our final stretch of the journey. And the next day, we reached our homes by 1:30 am.</p>
                    <p>
                        Numerous things went wrong during our journey, from my rear brake malfuctioning on a down hill stretch, struggles in finding a suitable accommodation, having unexpeceted bike issues etc, but we managed to conquer these challenges. These travel and these incidents reminds me that life is full of unpredictable twists and turns, uncontrollable things can happen in our life at anytime and how we react to them defines the true and pure essence of the journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>As this chapter comes to an end, I am left with excitement of what lies on the next page of my travel story.</p>

					<p>THE END</p>
