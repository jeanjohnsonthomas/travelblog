                    <p>Hey travelers,</p>
                    <p>The thought of traveling consistently provides me with daily motivation. Always planning for new trips, searching for new routes, researching travel locations etc. These are some of the activities that I enjoy doing. On one fine day I made the decision for our next trip. With two of my friends we devised a plan which leads us through a vast forest which is spread across three states, and through the flowerpot of India and finally to visit one of India's most beautiful villages. Welcome to an another travel blog</p>

                    <h2>DAY 1 : THE BEGINNING</h2>
                    <p>As usual we started our journey early in the morning from Alamcode. We met up at around 5:30 am, refueled our bikes and set out on our journey. Today's plan is to first visit Kochi to meet up with a friend, then to have breakfast at a restaurant after that we need to reach Nilambur before night. We had to cover a distance exceeding 360 kms. We started our trip early in the morning at 5:30 am. while we were traveling through the road in Kottayam we saw lots of people holding pink water Lily. It was the water lily season in that area and the place was attracting lots of tourists who came to witness the enchanting sight of vast water bodies adorned with large, blooming pink water lilies. We refrained from exploring further due to the increasing crowd. Along the way, we came across ponds adorned with white water lilies. Taking the opportunity to rest, we stopped at around 9:30 am to admire the serene beauty of the white water lilies.</p>

                    </section>

                    <p>After admiring the little things on the way we reached Kochi at around 11:00 pm. I wanted to try strawberry french toast, that is one of the reasons why we took the Kochi route. I caught up with my friend at the French toast restaurant around 11:15 am. I would recommend this toast if you're visiting Kochi. After saying farewell to my friend we continued the journey. The roads were bustling with activity, and the sun was blazing with intense heat. For anyone planning to do a long bike ride, invest in a hydration pack. It will significantly increase the efficiency of your trip. I make sure to carry it on every long ride because dehydration is a common concern, and having easy access to water will boost efficiency during the journey.</p>

                    <p>Everything was going smoothly until 2:00 pm, till my bike’s clutch cable broke. This time I was lucky, the auto drivers in that area showed me a nearby workshop and the place to buy new clutch cable. I bought the cable and the mechanic fixed my bike. I was having some good laughs with the auto drivers. They were incredibly friendly and were asking lots of questions about my travels etc. The interesting Thrissur slang added a nice touch, making me feel genuinely welcomed. We resumed our journey, making occasional stops to take breaks and to grab some food. After a challenging and lengthy trip, we finally reached CITY TOWER LODGE in Nilambur.</p>
                    
                    <h2>DAY 2:</h2>
                    <p>Today's plan is to visit Gundlupet via the Bandipur forest route and then to reach Ooty before night. Nilambur is just an intermediate stop for us. After having our breakfast, We resumed our journey. In order to reach Gundlupet we need to cross the Mudumalai forest in Tamilnadu, then the Bandipur forest in Karnataka. These forests are the part of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The roads in Mudumalai and Bandipur are well maintained and clean. As we continued our travel through the Mudumalai forest, we occasionally spotted flocks of deer, adding to the adventure and scenic beauty of the journey. At 11:55 am we crossed the Karnataka border and entered the Bandipur forest. It was also a well maintained forest area. you have to drive carefully, because elephants, deers and other wildlife can cross the road at any time.</p>

                    </section>
                    <p>At 12:15 pm we reached Bandipur Tiger Reserve Forest Department Guest House, where we paused briefly before continuing our journey. The trip after 12:30 pm was memorable. We were lucky enough to see spotted deer, wild pig, peacock, and langur monkeys. I was hoping to spot a tiger but didn’t succeed. The forest is unpredictable, wildlife sightings cannot be guaranteed at all times. I felt grateful for the experience we got through the forest journey, appreciating the beauty of the little things. After covering a few more kilometers, we finally arrived at Gundlupet, often referred to as "the flowerpot of India," around 1:00 pm.</p>
                        <section class="features">
                            <div class="image-container">

                        </section>
                    <p>We embarked on a search to find sunflower fields but faced disappointment. Upon inquiring from a local, we learned that the sunflower season had concluded just two days prior and the fields had already been harvested. They told us to cover some more distance and if we are lucky we may encounter some semi harvested fields. With the small light of hope we continued and found a beautiful marigold field. There was a small house near the field, and an old grandmother was doing some garden maintenance there. We asked permission to enter the marigold field. We even gave a small payment as a thanks and were allowed to explore the fields. It was blooming with lots of marigold flowers. A person in the field climbed a guava tree and plucked us some guavas, which were very tasty.</p>
                        <section class="features">

                        </section>
                    <p>After taking lots of pictures we started our journey towards Ooty via Masinagudi. The roads were quiet and peaceful to ride. At around 3:00 pm we spotted wild elephants standing near the forest, right by the road. It is not a good idea to stop your bike in a forest route, so we went on with the trip. One of the common sites in this route is the gathering of spotted deer, you can always spot a bunch of them together. We came across a scenic viewpoint and decided to halt there to search online for accommodation options in Ooty. Bison valley view point was its name. The sun's glare from between the hills added a special charm to the visuals plus the nice wind flowing through the air replenished our energy. After some calls we finally booked a stay and started the trip. As soon as we entered ooty a huge cloud of mist started to cover the area. We hadn't anticipated the sudden drop in temperature, and we found ourselves unprepared for the chilly weather that followed.</p>
                    <section class="features">
                        <div class="image-container">

                    </section>
                    </p>I was enjoying the view, and suddenly I got a call conveying that due to some circumstances our booking got canceled and they refunded our money. We were so hungry, we didn't have a good place to stay and it was getting colder and darker. We called some of our friends who had contacts in ooty and managed to get a stay. We quickly rerouted our navigation to the hotel and continued. On the way we saw the beautiful ooty lake. And finally at 6:00 pm we reached our accommodation. Once settled and rested, our foolish decision led us to venture into Ooty town in search of food. We were literally wearing thin t-shirts, because that’s all we have right now, and it was freezing cold. Stopped at a shop to buy chocolate, did some shopping, and bought food for us. In Ooty town after 10:30pm most of the shops will be closed, so if you want to buy food, buy it before 10:30 pm. We went into a pizza shop and asked permission to eat there, since it was cold outside. They happily let us in and we had our dinner.</p>
                    <h2>Day 3: </h2>
                    <p>As the sun rose, we woke up at 7:00 am and were greeted with a cold morning with a good view of Ooty from our accommodation. The chilly morning air caused our breath to appear as wisps of cold smoke. We started our descent from Ooty at 10:45 am, making a pit stop at a moving pickup shop to grab a quick breakfast. Indulging in Maggie noodles and toasted bread in the tranquil forest location not only satisfies our hunger but also warmed our heart.As our travel continued we were greeted with playful monkeys and stunning landscapes. On the way we saw people standing on the roadside with buckets full of honeycomb. Intrigued by the offer, we decided to purchase some honey, adding a sweet souvenir to our travel memories</p>

                    <p>By mid-afternoon, around 3:30 pm, we finally reached our stay near Kollengode, where we could unwind and reflect on the adventures of the past few days. The journey had been filled with unexpected twists and turns, from encountering wildlife in the forests to navigating through the streets of Ooty in search of food and shelter. As we settled into our stay, we couldn't help but feel a sense of joy and gratitude for the experiences gained and the memories created along the way.</p>
                    <h2>Day 4: The END</h2>
					
                    <p>Today's plan is to explore a little bit of Kollengode and then head back to our homes. We woke up early, packed our luggage and geared up for today's adventure. By 7:30 pm we reached Chellan Chetante Chayakada which is a famous small tea shop in Kollengode. Upon reaching the heart of Kollengode, we were greeted by the serene ambiance of the morning. The aroma of the freshly brewed tea from the small quaint hut nestled amidst the great landscape of Kollengode, also known as one of the beautiful villages in India, enveloped us in its tranquility and serenity. The Tea from Chellan Chettante Chayakkada was very tasty, Definity recommend this if you are visiting.</p>

					</section>
                    <p>We took the left road from the tea shop and at 8:00 am, we were greeted by the beautiful sights of towering hills adorned with cascading waterfalls. The spectacular view left us in utter amazement, urging us to explore further. After some minutes we reached the end of a narrow path, marked by a small temple. The view from this temple was so good, we were able to spot many small waterfalls falling from the hills of Nelliyampathy range. The climate was chill and windy. After taking a short break we made a spontaneous decision to venture onto a lesser-known trail to uncover hidden gems.</p>
                    <section class="features">

                    <p>
                        Returning to the tea shop, we opted for the road situated to the right of the shop this time. This road was less traveled. After looking at google maps we found a small unnamed water body near the base of the hills, no roads were shown on the map. We decided to find this water body. Our journey led us through rugged terrain, crossing small flowing shallow water crossing and riding steep off-road trails. Along the way, a fleeting glimpse of a peacock crossing our path enhanced enchantment of the moment. However, our expedition reached a halt at 8:50 am, as we encountered a dead end marked by electric fencing, reminding us of the limits of our exploration. Even though it was a dead end we clearly enjoyed the ride, it was fun and adventurous. And I advise not to try it when you are alone, since the fences are put there for a reason, to keep the wildlife inside the forest itself. We decided to end the adventure and return back home. After traveling for around 300 plus kilometers we reached alamcode at 7:30 pm
                    </p>

					</section>
                    <p>It was indeed an adventurous and beautiful journey. From the vibrant streets of Ooty to the serene forests of Mudumalai, each moment has etched its mark upon our hearts, creating unforgettable memories and experiences that we get to cherish for a long time. Despite the hurdles and unexpected turns along the way, our adventure had been nothing short of extraordinary. Gratitude filled our hearts as we reflected on the simple joys - the rustling leaves, the unexpected wildlife encounters, the crisp mountain air - that had made the journey truly special. With a sense of fulfillment and anticipation, we bid farewell to the road less traveled, carrying with us the essence of the forest and cherishing the memories of our epic journey through the lush landscapes of southern India.</p>
