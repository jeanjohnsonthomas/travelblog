                    <p>Hey travelers,</p>
                    <p>As usual we started our journey early in the morning. It was a one day trip and had to cover around 330 kms. We have only little knowledge about the place, all we know is there is an offroad and it is in vagamon. The ride through the cold foggy weather is always rewarding, we lost track of time and reached our first mandatory stop for every Munnar ride -  the stunning Valanjanganam WaterFalls. It was a monsoon ride and during this time the waterfall was a sight to behold, with the cascading water amidst the greenery, setting the tone for our adventure.

                    <p>We resumed our journey by relying on Google, which ultimately led us astray. The realization happend when we find ourselves on a desolate path, far from the expected route. We stopped to ask for guidance and locals informed us that while the route we reached was possible, it was sort of dangerous due to snakes and dense grass. Taking their advice, we recalibrated our course and reached the base of the road leading to Varattumedu. The air was filled with a sense of excitement as we prepared for the next leg of our journey.</p>
                    <p>The road leading to the top of the hill was rugged and off-road, and on top of that it was slippery because of the rain. Our bikes had top boxes, and it was quite difficult to do off road with that setup. We made a wise decision and parked our bikes at the base and started to hike towards the hill. The journey on foot was tiring, but the views that unfolded with each step were worth every bit of effort. On the way we saw several off-roaders struggling with their vehicles, adding to the sense of adventure. </p>

                        As we climbed higher, the scenery became increasingly breathtaking, along with the strong winds and the rapid fog change, made the views 100 times better. The views were full of greenery, like a lush green carpet of nature's finest hues. Once we reached the top we were greeted with the sight of an opposing hill, equally beautiful along with a cascading waterfall down its side.  The climate was extremely dynamic, the winds alternated between gentle breezes and fierce gusts, and fog came and went, adding a mystical quality to the landscape. For me it was like watching a movie with occasional drama scenes popping out of nowhere.

                        We spent a couple of hours admiring and soaking in the tranquility the place offered. We reluctantly decided to head back, since we had a long way to reach our home. On our way down I noticed a different route, a narrow path leading into a foggy unknown place. We saw a  glimpse of a jeep disappearing into a misty estate route which increased our curiosity. After a very short discussion we decided to explore the foggy route. Apart from the muddy and off-road conditions the place had an ethereal charm, which pulled us deeper with every step.

                        Immersed in the mesmerizing beauty, we lost track of our navigation and soon found ourselves lost. The google maps are showing no paths, just a small dot in the middle of nowhere. We debated on our next move, and decided to forge ahead. Since it was very foggy, we were not sure about the path, because some paths are splitting into 3 or more deviations and we were hoping that the one we take will lead to the exit. we encountered water crossings on the road, slippery muddy roads and beautiful locations. Streams flowed with a melodic sound, enhancing the serene ambiance and providing a soothing backdrop to our thoughts.The sound of water was a constant companion, a reminder of nature's persistent presence.

                        Stumbling upon a shed, we hoped to find someone who could help us, but it was empty. We pressed on, only to find ourselves at multiple dead ends. We tried to retrace our steps, but the dense fog made it impossible to find our original tracks.The fog was thick and disorienting, adding to the challenge of finding our way back. After circling for about 2 hours, Google maps shows us a possible starting path. We moved in that direction, the roads became increasingly narrower, eventually leading us to a small one person walkable bridge. My friend's bike, a Himalayan with side panniers, was too wide for the bridge, so we decided to experiment with my bike. The path leading to the bridge was narrow, with a flowing river on its right side. A small misstep, and we'd end up in the water

                        We committed to crossing the first bridge. Despite scratches on the crash guard and foot pegs from the bridge's rails, we made it across. Our confidence quickly faded as we faced a second, even narrower bridge with a very close guardrail on the right. The sight of the narrow passage made our hearts race, but we were determined to press on. Attempting the crossing, we got stuck midway. The powerful water below added to the tension, knowing one wrong move could send us plunging into the stream. With only one spanner, we tried to remove the crash guard, which ended in a failure. And ultimately deciding to reverse the bike. The situation was dire, and every second felt like an eternity.

                        Lifting the bike proved futile due to the side rails. Just as despair set in, a passerby approached and called for her son to help us. The boy's arrival felt like a miracle, a glimmer of hope in our challenging predicament. With his help we bent the rails slightly, allowing us to lift and reverse the bike. Guided by the helpful boy, we finally found our way back to the main road. The relief we felt was indescribable. Relieved and grateful, we headed to Munnar for food. Reflecting on our exhilarating adventure, we were thankful for the kindness of strangers and the beauty of nature that made the journey unforgettable.

                        Our return journey to Trivandrum was filled with stories of our adventure, each moment etched in our memories. The trip to Varattumedu, with its unforgettable beauty and challenges, was a testament to the unpredictable yet rewarding nature of motorcycle travel. Every twist and turn, every challenge we faced, added to the richness of the experience. With a smile and a tired heart we reached our home, I couldn't help but dream of where the next journey would take me.
