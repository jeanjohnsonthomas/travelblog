                    <p>Hey travelers,</p>
                    <p>Every ride feels different, and that unpredictability is what keeps pulling me back onto the
                        road. This trip was no exception — it had a bit of everything, and maybe a little more. Every
                        journey becomes a story and this time I am sharing one that would take you through historic
                        temples, mystical caves, powerful waterfalls, and vast plateaus. From lush landscapes of south
                        kerala, all the way to the cultural heartbeat of Maharashtra.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Ride Begins: Alamcode to Bangalore</h2>
                    <p>It was 5:00 AM when I kick-started my bike from Alamcode, with a chill in the air and the road
                        lit only by my headlights. This time my friend was also with me, with his himalayan. After
                        stopping at Kazhakootam to meet a friend who kindly gave us some food for the road - a small act
                        of kindness that turned out to be a help later on with that, we resumed our ride. The roads were
                        familiar until I reached Nagercoil, after which the adventure truly began. You can never miss
                        the sight of windmills in Nagercoil. Passing through bustling highways and serene patches of
                        countryside, we made our way towards Bangalore, the first long haul for the day</p>
                    <section class="features">
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="../imgs/10aug24_maha/intro.jpg" alt="Image description">
                        </div>
                    </section>

                    <p>We reached Bangalore late at night, exhausted but filled with excitement for what lay ahead.
                        After a quick recharge and a good meal, the next day’s destination was Hampi — a place I had
                        been dreaming of visiting for a long time.</p>

                    <h2>The Temples of Hampi & Tungabhadra Fury</h2>
                    <p>Halfway through our journey to Hampi, we received an alarming update that one of the gates of the
                        Tungabhadra dam had broken, and the water levels were rising. There was a moment of hesitation,
                        some quick Googling and discussion. We called some friends and searched for information on
                        whether the ride was going to be safe or not. After weighing things, we decided to continue,
                        keeping a close eye on the weather and updates.</p>
                    <section class="features">
                        <div class="image-container">

                    <p>
                        On the way to Hampi, at one place the National highway was passing through a sunflower field,
                        the golden sunflower field swaying under the afternoon sun was a sight to behold. Unfortunately,
                        time was critical and short, so we had to skip entering the field. But in my mind I made an oath
                        that if I came across any sunflower field on my way back I would surely enter it.
                    </p>

                    </section>
                    <p>Shortly after we reached Tungabhadra Bridge, we halted there to observe the dam which was
                        opposite to the bridge which we were standing on. The water level was alarmingly higher, because
                        of the broken gate. We didn’t spend much time there and we kept on riding.</p>
                    <section class="features">
                        <div class="image-container">

                    <p>
                        The landscapes were slowly changing to rugged terrain and scattered boulder formations. After we
                        reached near the ticket counter, we took the ticket and hurried to the electric bus which was
                        going to take us to the temple. The entry procedure was simple — tickets were reasonably priced
                        and the process was smooth. After a mild bumpy ride the site of vittala temple in the golden
                        hour came into sight. It was so beautiful, the golden rays hitting the ancient monument
                        exponentially increased the beauty of the place.
                    </p>
                    <section class="features">
                        <div class="image-container">

                    <p>
                        The serenity of the place was unreal. Everything was clean, quiet, and infused with the essence
                        of history. Since it was a UNESCO World Heritage Site, everything was well maintained. I truly
                        hope other tourist spots across India receive the same level of care and preservation as this
                        remarkable temple. One of the main reasons to visit this temple was to see the iconic Stone
                        Chariot that was immortalized on our ₹50 Indian note. Standing in front of it, I felt like I had
                        walked into the pages of history. We explored the temple complex slowly, soaking in the stone
                        carvings, the silence, and the sheer artistry of a time long past. Sunset along with the beauty
                        of the place made our mind in a peaceful state. I would urge one to visit this place during the
                        golden hours.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After soaking our souls in the beauty we saw, we travelled to our accommodation. That night, we
                        stayed at Jungle Tree Hostel at Hampi, a cozy, chill place surrounded by greenery. A perfect end
                        to a
                        day of culture and contemplation.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Through the Plateaus to Maharashtra</h2>
                    <p>
                        The next stretch was long, we headed to Aurangabad, which is currently known as chathrapathi
                        shivaji sambajar, and along the way my friend suggested that if we took a small deviation to
                        Vijayapura we would be able to visit Gol Gumbaz. We made a stop there and decided to explore it.
                        After purchasing the ticket which is 25 rupees, we slowly walked towards the tomb. This is a
                        mausoleum of Mohammed Adil Shah, who was the sultan of Bijapur during the 17th century. This
                        tomb is beautiful and it is famous for having one of the largest domes in the world without
                        supporting pillars. It is a remarkable one, both architecturally and historically
                    </p>
                    <section class="features">
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="../imgs/10aug24_maha/gol.jpg" alt="Image description">

                    </section>
                    <p>The road had less traffic and we felt truly alive as we cruised along, covering nearly 200
                        kilometers without a break, all thanks to the smooth, inviting stretch ahead. Gradually the
                        landscape was shifting from barren emptiness to vibrant stretches of plant life and greenery. As
                        we rode a little more further, we entered Maharashtra, welcomed by the sight of lush green
                        plateaus rolling endlessly in all directions. A complete shift from the arid old Hampi terrain,
                        every turn of the road offered a new view and fresh vibe.</p>
                    <section class="features">
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="../imgs/10aug24_maha/maharastra.jpg" alt="Image description">

                    </section>

                    <p>While riding through the heart of Maharashtra, we stumbled upon a vast open field, lush and
                        vividly green. We entered the field, parked our bikes under the open sky, and decided to pause
                        for a while and admire the breathtaking scenery that surrounded us. The landscape unfolded
                        endlessly with layers of green stretching as far as the eye could see. It was beautiful and I
                        think we were witnessing one of many beautiful plateaus this region is known for. We reached
                        Aurangabad by night and called it a day. We didn’t do much — just rested, letting the day’s ride
                        settle into memory.</p>

                    <h2>The Heritage of Aurangabad: Bibi Ka Maqbara & Ajanta</h2>
                    <p>We started our ride to Ajanta Caves during the morning, but before we embarked on the journey we
                        decided to visit Bibi Ka Maqbara. It is often called as Taj of the Deccan or mini Taj
                        Mahal because its structure and beauty resembles the Taj Mahal. This place was close to our
                        stay. We got the ticket and we explored the place. Since it was morning, not much of a crowd was
                        present. It is a beautiful Mughal-style mausoleum built by Aurangzeb’s son in memory of his
                        mother. It’s less crowded, peaceful, and offers a quiet glimpse into Mughal architecture.</p>
                    <section class="features">

                    </section>
                    <p>We then took off towards the legendary Ajanta Caves. To be honest the roads were tough , testing
                        both our endurance and patience. The long, isolated roads were good, but once we entered any
                        city, it started to get chaotic, with sudden appearance of animals such as cows, goats, horses
                        etc, and even people crossing roads without any indication. But reaching the site just before
                        sunset made every bump and struggle worth it.</p>

                    <p>Ajanta isn’t just a tourist spot, it’s a stunning glimpse into India’s ancient soul. After
                        grabbing our tickets, a shuttle bus took us through a peaceful stretch of forest, finally
                        dropping us off at what looked like a massive rocky mountainside which had dozens of caves
                        carved neatly into it. It felt unreal, like nature and history had conspired to build something
                        timeless. We explored most of the caves, each one telling stories through delicate murals,
                        intricate carvings, and serene Buddha sculptures. </p>

                    <p>Each cave had its own uniqueness, some had large sculptures and some with mural paintings etc and
                        they all are in well preserved form. Cave 26 impressed us with its massive reclining Buddha and
                        ornate carvings. Walking through them felt like flipping through pages of an ancient book. The
                        items in the caves were painted and sculpted by hands of the people who lived over 2,000 years
                        ago. During the sunset the sunrays casted a golden light on the stone walls and made the place
                        into a majestic one. After taking in all the visuals and living it, we started our ride back,
                        quietly carrying with us the weight and wonder of what we had just seen.</p>

                    <h2>Ellora Wonders and the Journey to Vijayapura</h2>

                    <p>After a well earned rest, we headed to Ellora caves. The road leading to ellora was far better
                        than the ajanta cave. After buying the ticket we entered the location. Ellora is another
                        masterpiece carved deep into the rock and time itself. Unlike Ajanta’s caves, Ellora brings
                        together Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain monuments, all coexisting within the same location and each
                        with its own style, and energy. The moment we stepped into the area, the sheer scale of it hit
                        us by surprise. I think all of the caves and temples were carved out of massive rocks.</p>
                    <section class="features">
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="../imgs/10aug24_maha/ellora.jpg" alt="Image description">

                    </section>
                    <p>The showstopper was the Kailasa Temple (Cave 16), a colossal monolithic structure carved from a
                        single rock from the top down. It is difficult to believe something like this was created over
                        1000's of years ago with no modern tools. I stood there, recognizing it from our ₹20 note,
                        completely taken aback by its majestic appearance. The intricate pillars, towering elephants,
                        detailed carvings of deities, every inch felt alive with beauty and brilliance.</p>
                    <section class="features">

                    </section>
                    <p>We wandered through several caves, each one echoing with silence and its own stories. The
                        Buddhist status (viharas) felt calm and meditative, while the Jain caves impressed with their
                        simplicity and grace. What made Ellora special was the feeling that you weren’t just seeing
                        history — you were walking through a living gallery of ancient Indian architecture and spiritual
                        philosophy, all carved by hand.</p>

                    <p>As the day wore on and the light shifted across the carvings, Ellora left us with a quiet sense
                        of wonder. There’s something deeply grounding about being in a place that took centuries to
                        build. The place is a reminder of what patience, purpose, and vision can achieve. With that
                        thought, we wrapped up our visit and began the ride to Vijayapura. The ride to Vijayapura was
                        peaceful with less traffic and long stretched straight roads. We reached Vijayapura and took a
                        rest at our accommodation.</p>

                    <h2>Sunflowers, Setbacks & Serendipity</h2>
                    <p>After soaking in Ellora’s wonders, our next destination was Yana Caves. On the way, I saw another
                        sunflower field and this time, nothing stopped me. I finally entered the field and ticked that
                        off my bucket list. The golden blooms, the blue sky, the breeze, a simple but perfect moment. It
                        was like a sea of sunflowers stretching to infinity, after taking lots of photos, we resumed our
                        trip</p>

                    <p>The road to yana caves was mixed with different feelings. Since it was during the pre monsoon
                        time, some of the roads were slippery and off road, but some roads were good. Before reaching
                        the entrance of the yana cave you will drive through a beautiful road inside a forest vibe area
                        which I really enjoyed. Unfortunately, Yana Caves were closed by the time we arrived. A minor
                        letdown, but things were about to get bumpier..</p>

                    <p>On the way to gokarna we discovered that my luggage carrier had broken, and to top it off, I
                        dropped and broke my navigation phone. But traveling teaches you resilience. We made a detour to
                        Gokarna, where we got both issues fixed, thanks to some helpful locals and quick thinking. We
                        stayed the night in Gokarna, and despite the hiccups, it turned out to be one of the most
                        peaceful rests of the trip.</p>

                    <h2>The Thundering Beauty of Jog Falls</h2>
                    <p>The next morning, we geared up for something spectacular, we were heading to Jog Falls, one of
                        the tallest and most majestic waterfalls in India. It was monsoon season, and we couldn’t have
                        picked a better time. The falls were in full force, thundering down with raw, breathtaking
                        power. As we arrived, the sheer roar of the water and the mist rising because of the waterfall
                        hit us like nature’s welcome. The whole scene felt alive, the sound, the spray, the towering
                        drop everything was intense, beautiful, and completely humbling.</p>

                    <p>We spent around 45 minutes soaking in the view, unable to pull our eyes away. Slowly, a thick fog
                        began to roll in, softening the view and wrapping the falls in a dreamy veil. It almost felt
                        like nature was drawing the curtain after its performance. Standing there, I felt like a quiet
                        observer, lucky to have witnessed such raw beauty in its fullest form.</p>

                    <h2>Wrapping Up in Bangalore & Heading Home</h2>
                    <p>We then made our way back to Bangalore and decided to take an extra day to rest. After all the
                        riding and exploring, this was much needed. We indulged in some amazing food and just
                        soaked in the laid-back vibes of the city. One highlight was tasting the iconic Ghee Podi
                        Idlifrom the famous Rameswaram Cafe, it was tasty.</p>

                    <p>As I rode back, a familiar kind of reflection settled in. From the ancient stones of Hampi to the
                        mystical carvings of Ellora, from sunflower fields to thundering waterfalls, this trip had
                        everything, history, chaos, calm, challenges, and unforgettable moments. Each place offered
                        something unique, a different mood, a different lesson. It reminded me why I ride, why I travel,
                        to discover, to get lost, to find new stories, and to create memories that linger long after the
                        roads end. This 4424 km will always be close to my heart and will cherish it forever.</p>
                    <p>Until the next ride, Keep exploring, keep wondering.</p>
