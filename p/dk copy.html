                    <p>Hey travelers,</p>
                    <p>“Why do I choose solo travels?”. It's a question that often comes my way since I do a lot of them and I love to do it. But the answer to that can't be encapsulated in mere words. For me I like the unparalleled freedom I get, you are not bound by the schedules or preferences of fellow travelers, you can stop anywhere, explore at your own pace, and venture off into uncharted territories. Solo travels offer a unique blend of self discovery, adventure and a connection with the world around me. These are the reasons why solo travels resonate with me. However there are challenges too. The fear of getting lost or experiencing bike breakdown in an unfamiliar location or losing YOUR LUGGAGE, and there are moments when solitude can feel overwhelming. Despite these potential drawbacks, solo travel has a special place in my heart, it helps me in my self-discovery and growth.
                        <br>
                    And this time, I am here to talk about a solo adventure story to Dhanush Kodi, a journey filled with the promise of new experiences and unforgettable moments and some misadventures.

                    <h2>DAY 1 : THE BEGINNING</h2>
                    <p>Before embarking on each trip, I do some planning, like when to reach, the backup plans etc. Since this is a two day trip the planning was relatively simple. Today's plan is to reach Rameswaram, then find accommodation and then explore Dhanush Kodi before night. I started the journey at dawn, around 4:16 am because I needed to reach Rameswaram before noon. First I have to reach Nagercoil then proceed to Rameswaram. The reason why I chose this road is because on this particular route you will be able to see lots of wind mills, big hills and the road is exceptionally smooth, offering a delightful riding experience. At around 6:00 am the hills and green fields started to appear, providing me with a refreshing sensation. A few more kilometers went by and lots of windmills started to appear on either side of the road.</p>

                    </section>

                    <p>I had traveled this route on bus and car, but I never had the chance to stop and get up-close look at the towering windmills. This time I did it, stopped to admire them, and also captured some videos and photos. I resume my journey with a smile on my face. Soon I was hungry, and I stopped at Arya's hotel on the way and had breakfast. At around 9:00 am, a gentle shower began to sprinkle. When I looked at the rear mirror I saw huge black rain clouds approaching me and my mind was saying we need to continue the journey . After riding through the rain for 1 and half hours I took a small break in a petrol pump. When I looked behind the petrol pump, I spotted some peacocks grazing in the field. The people told me this is a common site in this area. 5 to 10 mins went by and the rain finally stopped and I removed my rain coat and resumed the journey.</p>

                    <p>The road leading to Rameswaram is very peaceful. You will witness different types of landscapes on the road sides. Sometimes it's just barren lands, then after some kilometers the road side is full of palm trees, some areas have lush green views and you can also see small hills. It was also a very windy day, riding when the winds are strong can wear you off on long rides. While I was speeding away, a sudden glimpse of a green landscape caught my attention. Bringing my bike to a halt, I made a turn to explore what had caught my eye. It was a big pond covered in green algae. There was an old man near the pond and I had some nice conversation with him, he was the one who told me that it was algae and ponds with still water and warm temperature causes the algae to rapidly grow. After bidding farewells to the old man and curious little kids there, I continued my trip.</p>

                        At 12:45 I stopped because I was feeling hungry. This time I carried some snacks like Lotte Choco pie, biscuits, and a protein bar with me. It is good to have some kind of snacks with you when you go for long bike rides, it can provide you with some quick energy. Since I always carry my hydration pack with me, water was not an issue for me. I sat on a bench under a banyan tree and started to munch on the snacks. After eating, I made sure to carry the plastic waste with me since there were no garbage bins around. It's essential to be a responsible traveler and keep the surroundings clean. I continued my journey and soon I arrived at the renowned Pamban Bridge. I was taken aback by the mesmerizing sight of the light blue water beneath the bridge. The water's clarity was astounding, offering a clear view of the rocks at the bottom. It felt like someone color-graded the water. After taking in the beautiful sight, I entered Rameswaram and found myself a place to stay. I booked a room at TS-K-Marvel, the room was good enough. I put my luggage there, took some rest and started my trip to Dhanush Kodi at 2:30 pm.

                        As I embarked on my journey towards Dhanush Kodi, I couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty of the roads leading me to the end. Initially the road was flanked by buildings and small shops, like in a small urban area. Once I crossed the check post to Dhanush Kodi everything gradually transitioned. As I ventured further, the scenery began to change dramatically. Soon, I found myself riding alongside stretches of beautiful and clean beaches, with sea out on both sides. The transition from land to sea was gradual yet breathtaking, as the road seemed to disappear into the ocean, creating a feeling like I was suspended between two worlds. Road in the middle of the sea, with a nice calm wind, mesmerizing blue sea and I can see the vast sea disappearing into the distant horizon. It was a surreal experience, one that reminded me of the sheer magnificence of nature it has to offer to those willing to explore.

                        At 2:50 pm I reached the end of the road, which was gazing at the big mighty Indian ocean. Here you can witness the convergence of Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. After parking my bike I felt pulled towards the ocean, captivated by the sound of the calm waves on one side and the roaring of the Bay of Bengal on the other. I love the ocean because of the eternity it stands for, the more you look into it, the more I realize how small our lives are in comparison to its vastness. It also mirrors the vastness of life itself. I sat on the beach, closed my eyes, and admired the ocean. The sound of each wave calmed me down, I was at peace. After spending some time there I decided to explore the Dhanush Kodi.

                        I talked to some people there and they told me that on the way back, first visit the lighthouse then proceed to the “ Kothanda Ramar Temple '' to see the floating stone. I decided to do that and I resumed the trip. During the journey, I saw a clean beach with no one around. I stopped there and decided to spend some time on the beautiful undisturbed beach. After collecting some sea shells as a souvenir I recommenced. I reached the lighthouse area, and a woman called out to me, inviting me to dine at her hotel. Since I missed lunch, I entered the small hotel and chose a large fish from the collection, which she cooked for me. The tawa fish fry was delicious. After thanking her for the wonderful lunch, I went to see the lighthouse.

                        The entry ticket for reaching the top of the lighthouse was 20 rs per person. After collecting the ticket, I waited in the queue for my turn. There was a lift, but I decided to take the stairs which was a mistake since I had a heavy lunch. I reached the top, exhausted but it was for a few minutes because the view from the top and the cool breeze healed me. This is a must-visit place to see if you want to see the immense eternal ocean and the straight unbroken road to the end. The view is truly amazing. As usual after clicking some pictures, I proceeded to the next location which was “ Kothanda Ramar Temple ''. I reached the temple at around 4:40 pm. I met a traveler there. He introduced me to a travel community app called “couchsurfing”, which I later installed. After some pleasant conversation and bidding farewell to him, I proceeded to a small well which was “in” the sea.

                        When I reached there I saw two people holding a big stone and claiming that it could float. I went ahead and talked to them to get more information. One of them told me that the stone weighs around 15kg. To prove it he placed the big stone in my hand, yes- it's heavy. After that he put the stone in water, and it floated. During the conversation he told me that many such stones got lost during the tsunami that hit this place. It is also one of the reasons why this town is called the “Ghost Village”. Some of the land and houses are still inside the ocean and many souls were lost in this place. After hearing the stories from them and experiencing the stone, I headed back to my stay at Rameswaram. After taking some rest, I went out at night for some local shopping and to have dinner. I bought some things for my family and headed back to my accommodation where I fell asleep reflecting on my journey which led me to Dhanush Kodi.

                    <h2>DAY 2: THE MISADVENTURE</h2>
                    <p>Today marks the journey back, memories filling my soul as I set off on my return at 6:30 am.I stopped at the Pamban bridge one last time to admire the blue ocean. But the admiration was short lived, as colossal rain clouds engulfed the sky in a matter of minutes. The distant view of the ocean was getting blurred, at that moment I realized the rain was approaching and I needed to get out of there. I mounted my bike and started the return trip. Around 7:00 am rain caught up with me, and forced me to take shelter under a bus stand. The rain was intense, and it showed no signs of stopping anytime soon. I needed to reach home before dark, so I made up my mind, wore my rain gears and resumed my trip in the torrential rain. There was hardly any traffic and I was cruising through it. It was pouring heavily and all I could see and hear was rain.</p>

                    <p>I rode for about 1 hour and when I reached Ramanathapuram the rain stopped. I saw a restaurant nearby and parked my bike there. Suddenly I realized that my luggage was missing. I panicked for a moment and began rewinding my memories but no luck, I searched the nearby area and still didn’t find it. I decided to return to Rameswaram and search for the bag along the way. As each kilometer went by, desperation and frustration surged through me as I searched the roads, retracing my steps in the desperate attempt to recover my belongings. As the moment went by with worry and uncertainty, I grappled with the possibility of losing my bag. I made the mistake of putting my wallet in the bag which contained my credit card, debit card, RC book and other documents. After covering another 50 kilometers, I returned to Rameswaram, and still no sign of the bag. Now, I must traverse the same 50 kilometers once more, searching the route until Ramanathapuram for any sign of the bag.

                    <p>With zero luck I reached Ramanathapuram. Despite reaching out to friends and family for advice, the nagging feeling of helplessness lingered in me, casting a shadow over my spirit. I made my way to the nearby police station to report the missing bag, but they advised me to go to Rameswaram and file a complaint there, as I had lost it on the way from that location,which means I have to travel back to Rameswaram again. I decided that upon reaching home, I would work on obtaining replacements for the missing cards and documents. After setting transaction limits on my debit cards and credit cards I reluctantly resumed my journey, fighting with a whirlwind of emotions ranging from frustration to resignation. As I rode through the winding roads, each kilometer traversed brought a sense of calm amidst the chaos, reminding me of the endurance and fortitude inherent in every traveler's journey.</p>

                    <p>I traveled without stopping anywhere till 1:30 pm. I was hungry and decided to eat at a restaurant I saw on the way. Suddenly I got a phone call informing me that my bag had been found, a glimmer of hope emerged amidst the challenges. Relief washed over me and filled my heart and soul with happiness and relief. After talking with him I came to know that the only thing missing was my power bank. Since it was difficult to converse with the person because of the language barrier, I asked the waiter in the restaurant to help me sort it out. He told me to send my address to that person so that he can courier the bag to me. After thanking both of them, I began munching on the delicious meal. My heart was already full with gratefulness and I am happy that kind people like them still exist in this big universe. After bidding farewell to the waiter who helped me, I resumed the trip fueled by the determination to reach my destination before nightfall.</p>

Meeting a friend in Trivandrum to have a hearty meal, I reflected on the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity, how people stay strong when things are tough and feel better with the help of friends and family. After exchanging farewells with my friend I slowly rode my bike and reached home at 8pm and saw the smiling and concerned faces of my family members.</p>

                    <p>As I reflect on my journey to Dhanushkodi, I am overwhelmed by the experiences and emotions that filled my soul. From the awe-inspiring beauty of the roads leading to the end, to the tranquil embrace of the ocean waves. The journey taught me the importance of embracing the unknown, of seeking solace in the midst of chaos, and of finding beauty in the simplest of moments. The kindness of strangers, the serenity of the ocean, and the resilience of the human spirit are all reminders of the enduring power of exploration and discovery. I embraced the journey, flawed yet beautiful in its imperfections, cherishing the memories of my solo adventure to Dhanush Kodi and the unexpected twists that made it truly unforgettable. I am eagerly waiting for the dawn of the next adventure, with a renewed sense of wonder and gratitude, ready to embark on the next chapter of my journey with an open heart and a spirit of adventure.
