                    <p>Hi Travellers,</p>
                    <p>Two wheels, endless horizons, and a thirst for adventure - This is a story of an
                        unforgettable motorcycle journey that we had. Usually, I prefer riding alone, and my
                        initial plan was to visit Poondi in Kodaikanal. However, everything changed when one
                        of my buddies posed an intriguing question: &quot;Why not embark on a long journey
                        outside Kerala? A sudden realization sparked within me, aligning with one of the
                        items on my long-held bucket list: to travel outside Kerala and Tamil Nadu on my
                        bike. After some extensive searching, I finally came up with a thrilling 2000-plus
                        km bike ride. We were super thrilled to embark on this adventure. This was a summer
                        season with raging temperatures so we had to be well prepared. With riding gears and
                        all the necessary things, we started the adventure.</p>

                    <h2>DAY 1 : THE BEGINNING</h2>
                    <p>The journey started from a BP petrol pump in Paripally. we refilled our bikes and hit
                        the road around 5:30 am. By 7:00 am we reached Thenmala and took a quick break to
                        admire the beauty of the forest.Early morning in the woods, accompanied by the melodious 
						chirping of birds, the gentle hum of crickets, 
						and a refreshing cool breeze, invigorated our souls. After some kilometers
                        of riding, we crossed the Kerala border and entered Tamil Nadu. Decided to have
                        breakfast at Kumar&#39;s Biryani Dharbar, Sivagiri Tamil Nadu.</p>
                    <p>On the way to Madurai, we were approached by a boy named Shiva who was also en route
                        to Madurai. He invited us to have tea at a local tea shop, we were initially hesitant at
                        first due to our unfamiliarity with the area. But we enjoyed pleasant conversations
                        with him and other strangers before resuming our journey. There’s a beauty that lies
                        in these fleeting connections with strangers, unsure if our paths will meet again,
                        but the richness of the moment fills our hearts.</p>
                    <section class="features">

                    </section>
                    <p>The presence of grazing sheep in the fields and the view of the majestic hills and
                        mountains in the distance provided us a distraction from the extreme temperature
                        during our journey. We didn&#39;t stop much on the way because we wanted to reach
                        Madurai before noon. The reason we are stopping there is to fulfill one of my desire
                        which is to have Jigarthanda from Madurai. It&#39;s a refreshing cold beverage that
                        is famous over there. We reached there at 1:00 pm and had Jigarthanda and some food
                        from a local restaurant. We did some online scouting and found a hotel for us to
                        stay in Vellore, our day 1 destination and to reach there we still have to travel
                        around 400 km. After booking the hotel we resumed our journey to Vellore.</p>

                    </section>
                    <p>Three riders, cruising through the forest at night, empty road and it was terrific.
                        On the way we came across some fires on the roadside, one was even on the road. 
						I believe the wind may have nudged it onto the road. It was quite unsettling to see fire on
                        the lonely road. However, we crossed it and reached our accommodation at around
                        11:30 pm. We stayed at Golden Gateway at Vellore. It was a relief to reach there,
                        considering we had traveled almost 700km which include some detours to see some
                        windmills, trying to explore some less crowded paths, and seeing if we can find some
                        beautiful places along the way.</p>
                    <h2>DAY 2: Gandikota</h2>
                    <p>We woke up around 9:00 am, had our complimentary breakfast, and left the hotel at
                        around 10:30 am. Today&#39;s plan is to reach Gandikota (The Grand Canyon of India)
                        before sunset. This was the main destination of this journey. A total of 320 km is
                        to be covered to reach the destination. The road was spectacular, with no traffic at
                        all. We were cruising through the road effortlessly. Stopped here and there to take
                        some pictures. Also stopped at some small shops on the way to have drinks like goli
                        soda, some kind of grape-flavored soda drinks, etc. At one point I decided to go
                        ahead, but after a few minutes, I stopped because I can&#39;t see my friends. I
                        called and he told me that his bike is not moving. Luckily I stopped right in front
                        of a small bike workshop. I couldn&#39;t understand a single word they said to me.
                        Even though I didn&#39;t know the language I somehow managed to convey the message
                        and he agreed to accompany me. Anyway, the bike was temporarily fixed and we resumed
                        our journey.</p>
                        <section class="features">
                            <div class="image-container">
                                <img src="../imgs/gandikota/day2_bike.JPG" alt="Image description">

                        </section>
                    <p>Finally, we reached Gandikota around 5:00 pm, the perfect time to visit. Since we
                        were on bikes, we were able to ride inside the fort. The ride through the fort gate
                        and the stone pathways was remarkably enjoyable. We parked our bikes and started
                        exploring the fort, which had some old architecture like a masjid, temple, mahal,
                        etc. After exploring the fort area, we went to the viewpoint. Gazing at the Grand
                        Canyon after a long ride was like having a good meal after starving for hours, It
                        was fulfilling. The view was magnificent. The climate was perfect, not too hot and
                        it was windy. We lay down, and enjoyed the cold breeze, the peaceful atmosphere, and
                        the breathtaking view, waiting for the sun to disappear. Lots of things flashed
                        through my mind, like I never expected anything during this journey yet the travel
                        was so rewarding, the hardship we endured together, the lesson we learned during
                        this journey, it was all worth it. A sense of happiness was overflowing within me,
                        as I embraced the beauty of The Grand Canyon Of India.</p>
                        <section class="features">
                            <div class="image-container">
                                <img src="../imgs/gandikota/day2_enter.JPG" alt="Image description">

                        </section>
                    <p>After spending about 2-3 hours, we exited the fort at around 8:00 pm. Later, we had
                        dinner at a restaurant outside the Fort area. while having conversations with people
                        there one of them told us that the road to Bangalore is terrible, there is no shop,
                        no fuel station nothing on that way. Just bad roads through some forest. After
                        having our food and preparing mentally we left Gandikota. In order to reach Banglore
                        we have to travel about 290 km. We turned on our fog lights and embarked on the long
                        and risky night ride (not recommended).</p>
						<section class="features">
                            <div class="image-container">
                                <img src="../imgs/gandikota/gandikota.jpeg" alt="Image description">
                            </div>
                        </section>
                    <p>The ride to Banglore was a physically challenging one. Many potholes and occasionally
                        we encounter the bright lights of big trucks. We can’t stop and take a rest because
                        the road is passing through a forest, if something happens it is very difficult to
                        get help. The travel continued for a long time and we finally reached Bangalore at
                        around 4:00 am the next day. One of our friends was waiting there, he was traveling
                        to Bangalore from Kerala, and he reached one hour before us. After regrouping
                        somewhere near Kormangala we booked accommodation near to that place. overall it was
                        an adventurous journey and we were exhausted.</p>
                    <h2>DAY 3: Bangalore</h2>
                    <p>Our plan for day 3 was to explore Bangalore City and to take some rest to regain our
                        strength. But before that, my friend&#39;s bike needed to be serviced. we went to
                        the respective service centers, one KTM and the other Royal Enfield, and gave the
                        bikes for service. The main reason why I wanted to visit Banglore is to have edible
                        gold foil-covered ice cream, which I came to know about while I was searching for
                        gold-covered food to eat lol. Once everything was in order we head out to Huber and
                        Holly to have that ice cream. It was delicious and I felt a sense of joy in crossing
                        off another item from my bucket list.</p>

                            <div class="image-container">

                        </section>
                    <p>Two of our friends were in Bangalore, and they came to visit us. and we started
                        exploring together. We went to the commercial street in Shivaji Nagar. It was
                        crowded as hell, was difficult to ride a bike through the crowd, and also very
                        difficult to find a parking spot. A stranger told us that there is a plaza nearby
                        which has a pay and park system. So if you are planning to visit a commercial street
                        try to find a plaza or mall and park your bike there which is convenient and safer
                        than leaving your vehicle outside. Anyway, we continued to explore the street and
                        had some iced cola, etc. After that, we went to visit the food street in VV Puram.
                        There were plenty of small food stalls with a variety of items to eat. was so
                        confused about what to eat. We tried smoked ice, it&#39;s just a wafer that was
                        frozen, when you eat it smoke comes out from your mouth LOL. We also tried rabadi
                        falooda, raj kachori, etc. All of it was delicious. After the exploring, we went
                        to get the serviced bikes and decided to spend the night in one of our friend&#39;s
                        house which were aesthetically beautiful. That is how we spend our last day in
                        Bangalore with lots of memories.</p>

                    <p>Bangalore, there is a hidden charm in the chaotic rhythm. Everything was vibrant and
                        full of life, even though it was crowded most of the time. We were able to find the
                        chaotic beauty of the busy streets and had a blast.</p>
                    <h2>Day 4: The END</h2>

					</section>
                    <p>After saying our goodbyes we started our journey back to home. It&#39;s a 700km
                        journey. The return drive was slow-paced; we took some power naps on the way to
                        regain our strengths. Finally, we reached home at around 4:30 am the next day. This
                        travel etched lots of experiences into my heart. I will never forget the laughter we
                        had together, the little things that made us happy, the struggles and challenges we
                        faced, etc. These moments of adventure, growth, and connection are the treasures we
                        can carry within our hearts for a lifetime.</p>
                    <p>And I can&#39;t wait to see where the road takes me next.</p>
